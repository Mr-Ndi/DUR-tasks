# DUR-tasks About  Library Management System API

This is an Express.js-based API for managing a library's database, which includes authors, books, members, and loans. The API provides the following functionality:

1. ## Authors:
   - Fetch all authors
   - Fetch a single author by ID
   - Create a new author
   - Update an existing author
   - Delete an author

2. ## Books:
   - Fetch all books
   - Fetch a single book by ID
   - Create a new book
   - Update an existing book
   - Delete a book

3. ## Members:
   - Fetch all members
   - Fetch a single member by ID
   - Create a new member
   - Update an existing member
   - Delete a member

4. ## Loans:
   - Fetch all loans
   - Fetch a single loan by ID
   - Create a new loan
   - Update an existing loan
   - Delete a loan

The API uses a MySQL database to store the data and provides error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes for the responses.

The code is organized into separate functions for each CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation, which are then used in the route handlers to handle the incoming requests.

This API can be used as a starting point for building a library management system or integrated into a larger application that requires book and member management functionality.
